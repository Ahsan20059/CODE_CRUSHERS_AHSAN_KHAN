BINZ PROJECT 
About Bin-Z
At Bin-Z, we believe in rewarding responsible waste disposal. Our platform encourages users to keep their surroundings clean by providing incentives for proper waste disposal. We have implemented several key features to make the experience seamless and engaging.

What We’ve Built So Far
- ✅ User Registration & Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and securely access their accounts.
- ✅ Waste Listing System: Users can list waste materials they want to sell or recycle.
- ✅ Point-Based Reward System: Every time a user uploads a video of throwing waste into designated dustbins, they earn Bin-Z Coins that can be redeemed for real money.
- ✅ Admin Panel: A dedicated admin dashboard for managing users, waste listings, and verifying videos.
- ✅ Leaderboard: Displays the top 3 users based on coins earned, showing only their username and user ID to maintain privacy.
- ✅ Total Waste Counter: A dynamic counter on the homepage showing the total kilograms of waste recycled with an animated effect.
- ✅ Scrap Rates Display: The website header includes a Scrap Rates section for transparency.
- ✅ Contact & Support Page: Users can easily reach out for help through the support section.

What’s Next?
We are continuously working on improving Bin-Z. Future updates will include location-based search, real-time messaging, and more features to enhance user experience.
